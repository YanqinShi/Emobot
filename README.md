Usage Tips & Best Practices
To ensure the best possible presentation experience, please follow these tips:

✅ Tip 1: Internet Connection (AI Chat)
•	Instruction: The Emotional Chat feature relies on the ChatGPT API for real-time responses.
•	Note: Please do not disconnect from the internet while chatting; otherwise, the pet will not be able to provide intelligent replies.

✅ Tip 2: Browser Compatibility
•	Instruction: For the smoothest animation performance (60 FPS), we recommend using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
•	Note: Safari may render the "Glassmorphism" (background blur) visual style slightly differently, though all functionality remains perfect.

✅ Tip 3: Audio Settings
•	Instruction: The Mini-Games and Pet Interactions include sound effects.
•	Recommendation: Please unmute your device to fully experience the immersive sound design (e.g., coin collection sounds, chat notifications).
